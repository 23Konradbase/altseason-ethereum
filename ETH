Ethereum is a global, open-source, decentralized blockchain platform that allows for the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Its native cryptocurrency is ether (ETH), which powers the network by paying for transactions and computational services. Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily for digital currency, Ethereum is a programmable platform designed to enable a wide range of use cases, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).
